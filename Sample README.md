## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with a tutor and several bootcamp colleagues to explore the fundamentals of Javascript and clarify my work. I also worked through the modules on Codecademy to better develop my understanding of NodeJS to enable me to solve this challenge.

## Tests

To test and validate the README generation, you can run the application multiple times with different inputs. Review the generated README.md file to ensure it meets your expectations and provides comprehensive project information.
